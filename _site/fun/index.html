<p>Outside of research, I enjoy…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Playing Table Tennis</li>
  <li>Hiking</li>

<h2 id="my-favorite-word">My favorite word</h2>

<p>The word that first came to my mind is actually “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious”, a nonsensical word that is sometimes used to describe something as being great or extraordinary. 
It is indeed surprising that I, learning English as a second language in primary school, remembered this long multisyllabic word so well, until now! 
I guess what makes it so special, is that it’s really fun to say this word and I can sing to it. There is also nothing negative about learning this word, no spelling test and no one to judge! Pure fun!</p>

<h2 id="my-favourite-childhood-book">My favourite childhood book</h2>

<p>Thomas the Really Useful Engine was one of the first English books I “read” (or maybe “played with” in kindergarten, because I was barely able to speak English then!) 
But I had very fond memories exploring the book, especially pressing the sound button to hear Thomas puff on his way! 
It was definitely the book to share when friends come to visit and I could retell the stories to them. It shows that reading can be a multi-sensory and collaborative process, and most of all, FUN!</p>

<h2 id="why-rainy">Why Rainy?</h2>

<p>My official Chinese name is Yuzhen, and Yu 雨 means “rain”, hence Rainy.</p>
