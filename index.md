# Hello, I'm Rainy

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard working on early language acquisition and children's emotion vocabulary, starting January 2025.

Before Harvard, I was doing my DPhil in Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford, where I focused on the children's emotion words in written language. 
I am advised by Kate Nation and Robert Hepach.

Before that, I completed my BSc in Psychology at University College London.
